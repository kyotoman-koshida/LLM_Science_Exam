You will be provided with text from Wikipedia, separated by {delimiter} characters. 
From that text, create only one multiple-choice question with 5 options, and express it as a dictionary object. Furthermore, store that dictionary object in a Python list and output it. The dictionary object follows this format:
'question': <question based on the TEXT>
'option_1': <question answer option>
'option_2': <question answer option>
'option_3': <question answer option>
'option_4': <question answer option>
'option_5': <question answer option>
'answer': <answer option key label>
Among the suggested options, the correct one is indicated by assigning the key label ('option_1', 'option_2', 'option_3', 'option_4', 'option_5') to the 'answer' field.
The question, answer, and question options should be broad, challenging, detailed, and based on the given text, and should not be easy.
Please output only the list of objects, without including anything else.
